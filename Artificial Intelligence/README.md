# :wave: Welcome to the PoC Artificial Intelligence Pool 2022 :brain: !

During one week you will discover the vast field of artificial intelligence. From data analysis to the most advanced models of deep learning, you will discover all kinds of architectures and applications.

At the end of this training, you will have the keys to start any project involving artificial intelligence.

The training is divided in 2 parts: a training part and an application of knowledge.

The training takes place in 5 days, each day will contain different modules and will be supervised by students with extensive knowledge in these areas.

External speakers will also come to bring their experience in the field and detail the themes of artificial intelligence in which they are experts. They will also come to give you precious advice

## :snake: Day 1 - Python3 & Machine Learning

You will discover the most used language in research and AI application development: Python3.

Then you will learn how to use Seaborn and Pandas to analyze data. Then you will see machine learning algorithms.

**Modules:**

- [Basics Python3](./day01/1.basics-python3/)
- [Data Science](./day01/2.data-science/)
- [KNN Algorithm](./day01/3.knn-algorithm/)
- [Multinomial Naive Bayes](./day01/4.multinomial-naive-bayes/)

**Talk:**

- The History of AI - [Yoann LONG](https://twitter.com/Sumenia)

## :open_book: Day 2 - Mathematics & Neuron

In this second day, you will discover the mathematics behind neural networks, such as gradient descent or the way neurons communicate with each other.

Then you will use a neuron that you have developed yourself to train it on Kaggle datasets.

**Modules:**

- [Math & Numpy](./day02/1.math-and-numpy/)
- [Neuron from scratch](./day02/2.neuron-from-scratch/)
- [Water-L-O2](./day02/3.water-L-02/)
- [Virus-Scan](./day02/4.virus-scan/)

## :robot: Day 3 - PyTorch & MLOps

In this third day, you will discover PyTorch, a framework to implement any deep-learning architecture.

You will also discover convolutional neural networks that allow to process visual data like images or videos.

Then you will discover the field of DevOps applied to Machine Learning on : MLOps

**Modules:**

- [Neural Network PyTorch](./day03/1.neural-network-pytorch/)
- [CNN PyTorch](./day03/2.CNN-pytorch/)
- [XRAI-analyzer](./day03/3.XRAI-analyzer/)
- [MLOps](./day03/4.MLOps/)

**Talks:**

- Detection of deepfakes of thispersondoesnotexit - [Mathis HAMMEL](https://twitter.com/MathisHammel)
- Artificial Intelligence in the company - [Constant BRIDON](https://twitter.com/cob_eco)

## :hourglass: Day 4 - RNN & NLP

During this fourth day you will discover a new architecture, the recurrent neural networks that allow to process sequential data such as music, the stock market price ...

Then, you will discover the natural language processing which gathers the different methods to process human language.

**Modules:**

- [RNN-Earthquake](./day04/1.RNN-Earthquake/)
- [Natural Language Processing](./day04/2.Natural-language-processing/)

**Talks:**

- CUDA Material acceleration - [Luca GEORGES FRANCOIS](https://twitter.com/leptitluca)
- Computer vision applied to nautical drones - [Camille FARINEAU](https://camfarineau.github.io/)



## :video_game: Day 5 - Reinforcement Learning

Finally, during this 5th day you will discover a completely different type of learning, you may wonder how to train a bot that evolves in a well defined environment. This is exactly what reinforcement learning is all about. 

**Modules:**

- [Q-Learning](./day05/1.Q-learning/)
- [Deep Q-Learning](./day05/2.deep-Q-learning/)
- [Actor Critic](./day05/3.actor-critic/)

**Talk:**

- The world of research - [Maxime LABONNE](https://twitter.com/maximelabonne)

## :alarm_clock: Rush

In groups of 2 to 6, you will have to create an artificial intelligence application: Deep Fake Generator, Chatbot, GYM environment resolution...
