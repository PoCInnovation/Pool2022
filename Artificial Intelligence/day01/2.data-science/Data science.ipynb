    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Science & Data scientist\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going futher in this subject, let's start by a short definition of what Data Science is : Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data and apply knowledge and actionable insights from data across a broad range of application domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Data Scientist is often seen as a handyman from fetching the data to putting a machine learning model in production.\n",
    "In reality, each part related to AI and Data as its own job : The Data Miner fetches the data, the machine learning engineer builds machine learning models and the MLOps deploys those models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to see the Data scientist (which I prefere) is as the one who knows how to handle all works related to data : Data mining, Data exploration, interpretation of the data, its visualization and its processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not go any further into details of each job in AI but if you want to know more I advise you to read [this great book](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/contents/chapter-1.-ml-jobs.html) written by _Chip Huyen_ who explains each job in every part of AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What you will see in this subject\n",
    "\n",
    "In this subject you will discover a few bases of Data Science : How to manipulate data, explore it, vizualise it and interpret it.\\\n",
    "Eventually, you will learn how to use a machine learning model using the `sklearn` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask other candidates or one of the supervisors.\\\n",
    "Good luck and have fun."

    "\n",
    "Before manipulating our data or even interpreting it we need to explore it, to know what type of data do we have and what does it mean.\\\n",

    "### I-II Set indexes\n",
    "\n",
    "Nice! We now have a better understanding of our data. It seems like we are facing the `titanic` dataset, referencing each passager who were on board of the titanic.\\\n",
    "Our goal is to explore this dataset and finally to create a simple machine learning model to predict if a passenger survived using its informations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a better understanding of our data, here is a description of each columns :\n",
    "* **PassengerId** : ID of the passenger.\n",

    "* **Cabin** : Cabin number.\n",
    "* **Embarked** : Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above informations, we can see that the `PassengerId` colomn is just full of indexes referencing each passagenrs.\\\n",

    "### II-I Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before creating our model (promised this is the last step of preparation) we must create a testing and training set (\"_Set what?_\" Said a student in the distance).\\\n",
    "To understand what a test set is and why it is necessary it is best to go over what machine learning is so let's start with a short definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "<ins>Machine learning</ins>: Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data. It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things to remember from this definition:\n",
    "- \"_computer algorithms that can improve automatically_\": In machine learning, we do not directly create the solution but an algorithm that will adjust \"automatically\" until potentially reaching the desired result.\n",
    "- \"_can improve automatically through experience and by the use of data._\": Our model learns thanks to data, so the model is not at the center of our attention, it is first and foremost our data that is.\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning model will adjust to meet a single criterion: Bringing the _cost_ closer to zero.\\\n",
    "As a reminder, the loss function (producing the loss) is a function which from a prediction and labels indicates how wrong the model is, the closer the loss is to zero, the better.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate these remarks, I suggest that we take a look at the cost function nammed MSE (mean squared error).\\\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/education/formulas2/355397047/en/mean_squared_error.svg\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We have here named $Y_i$ the model prediction for a numbered data item $i$ and $\\hat{Y}_i$ the result expected by our model for this same numbered data $i$.\\\n",
    "We sum the results obtained for each data numbered from $0$ to $n$ and take the average of this sum by dividing the result by $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We thus obtained the average difference between the predictions of the model and the expected results, it is our cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loss is practical to verify the learning of a model, it suffices to verify that the cost decreases as the model learn. On the other hand, if I show you a cost of $100$, it's hard to know if it's good or not, that's where the accuracy comes in, it's the percentage of times the model has found the right result.\\\n",
    "An accuracy of $50%$ would mean that our model is wrong every other time, $90%$ once in 10, etc ...\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, we cannot always have an accurary, take for example a model which aims to predict the exact speed of a car.\\\n",
    "He predicted $121.5km/h$ and the car was going at $119km/h$, you can't tell your model is \"right\" or \"wrong\". You will say rather that it was wrong of $2.5km/h$ (which is a loss).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"_And our history of testing and training set, is where in there? _\" Exclaims the impatient.\\\n",
    "If we summarize, our model learns on the data we give it and tries to reduce the cost calculated according to the prediction of our model and the expected results but if we want to know how our model behaves on the data that it does not have ever seen how we do it? We create a test set, a set of data our model had never see and test it on it ...\n",
    "\n",
    "Our training set is the data that is used by our model to train, our test set is a data that our model has never seen that we use to know how behaves on a data that he has not seen before.\n",
    "To be precise there is even a third set called the validation set but we will not discuss it for the moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here as we do not have only one csv, we will have to divide it into two sets (training and testing). \\\n",
