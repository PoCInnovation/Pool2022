    "### Multinomial Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is a probabilistic learning method that is mostly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The algorithm is based on the Bayes theorem and predicts the tag of a text such as a piece of email or newspaper article. It calculates the probability of each tag for a given sample and then gives the tag with the highest probability as output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifier is a collection of many algorithms where all the algorithms share one common principle, and that is each feature being classified is not related to any other feature. The presence or absence of a feature does not affect the presence or absence of the other feature.\n",

    "\n",
    "We are going to perform a multinomial Bayesian classification in order to be able to classify a sms as a spam or as a ham (Ham is a message which is not a spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you will first process the dataset: ``./data/SMSSpamCollection`` so that it best fits our application. Then we will apply Bayesian classification on test data to evaluate the performance of our program.\n",
