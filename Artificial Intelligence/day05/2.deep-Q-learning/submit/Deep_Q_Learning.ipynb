    "The Bellman Equation tells us how to update our Q-table after each step we take. To summarize this equation, the agent updates the current perceived value with the estimated optimal future reward which assumes that the agent takes the best current known action. In an implementation, the agent will search through all the actions for a particular state and choose the state-action pair with the highest corresponding Q-value.\n",

    "The iterative process of updating the Q-Values of each state-action pair on a larger state space will become exponentially inefficient.\n",

    "Rather than using value iteration to compute Q-Values and find the optimal Q-Function, we can instead use a function approximator to estimate the optimal Q-Function.\\\n",
    "And you know what can do an excellent job at approximating functions ? That's right: deep neural networks.\\\n",
    "The neural network will be responsible for **evaluating** states. (ie. determine the expected reward of each action on a givent state)\n",
