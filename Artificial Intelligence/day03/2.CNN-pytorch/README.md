# Module 10: Convolutional Neural Network :pencil:

Welcome to the tenth module of the course. You must have already learned a lot. In this part you will discover an architecture that comes straight from our national Yann LeCun. We are going to talk about convolutional networks that allow to process visual data like images or videos.

## Submit :trophy:

Fill the notebook: ``convolutional_neural_network.ipynb``

To submit your work, think about pushing your changes. It is important to push so that we are able to assess participation.
If you have any concerns, talk to a supervisor.
