# Module 9: Neural Network with PyTorch :pencil:

You have passed the hardest part for an IT student. From now on, we will no longer bother with mathematics thanks to the PyTorch framework, a high-level python library developed by Meta AI Research.

# PyTorch :robot:

PyTorch is the deep learning framework used in research. It allows to create any kind of neural network, to train it and to make predictions with it. For example it is possible to predict if a sentence is positive or negative, detect a cyber-attack, translate text, detect objects on an image, detect earthquakes ... In fact the possibilities are endless.

In this module you will first have to install PyTorch ``pip3 install torch`` and import it. You will discover tensors which are data structures used in deep learning which are actually matrices. Then you will generate data using a mathematical function.

At the end of this part you will develop a neural network using PyTorch that will be able to find the mathematical function that generated the data in order to find the relationship.

## Submit :trophy:

Fill the notebook: ``src/neural_network_pytorch.ipynb``

To submit your work, think about pushing your changes. It is important to push so that we are able to assess participation.
If you have any concerns, talk to a supervisor.
