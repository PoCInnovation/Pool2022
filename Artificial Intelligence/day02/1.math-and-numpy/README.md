# Module 5: Math & Numpy :pencil:

Welcome to the first module of the second day, I hope you still have the motivation and determination to understand artificial intelligence. In this part, we will look at the mathematics behind supervised learning. This module is complicated for more IT than mathematical profiles but don't give up, we will soon see the use of frameworks that allow the abstraction of mathematics, but it is important to understand them to master the different frameworks.

## Math & Numpy :heavy_division_sign:

You are going to discover the Numpy library which allows you to work directly with arrays or multidimensional matrices. This is an important strength because you will see that our data always looks like a matrix.

After that you will discover the most emblematic algorithm of artificial intelligence, the gradient descent which simply allows our program to learn.

Gradient descent is an algorithm that allows us to find the minimum of a function.

Here is a simple example

We'll come and calculate our gradient using the derivative of the function and subtract it from our value, which will have the effect of bringing us closer to the minimum.

In this rather simplistic case, we can say that it is not so hard. But our cost function (which is the function whose minimum we are looking for) doesn't really look like that very often, a rather complex example

And still we are on a rather simple case, in artificial intelligence we often have hundreds of parameters for two on the example.

Good luck and courage!
