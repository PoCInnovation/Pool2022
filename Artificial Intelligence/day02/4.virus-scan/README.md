# Module 8: Analyse Virus :pencil:

Hello technical team, the hour is serious we know that we solicit you enormously but your work is useful and contributes to the survival of humanity!

We have detected a new virus capable of accelerating heart problems. We are conducting further analysis to find out where it comes from and who it might affect. We have provided you with data and we would like you to develop an AI capable of predicting who is likely to contract a severe form of this virus.

We are counting on you!

## Instruction: 

Refer to the file maxi_neurone.py 

> You need to improve your Neuron class because the problem here is no longer linear but binary "yes or no".

+ Create a sigmoid_activation function which represents the forward of the sigmoid.

> This function takes as parameter the inputs 

+ Create a function d_sigmoid_d_input which represents the derivative of the sigmoid (and thus the backward). 

> This function takes as parameter the inputs  

--- 

Refer to the file virus_scan.py 

> You have in the "Data" folder all the necessary data.  

+ Create a getData function to retrieve and clean the data (don't forget to normalize). 

> Use panda and study well the data 

+ Create a function (an iterator) to separate the data in batch 

+ Implement the python main using your Neuron class to have an AI able to predict if a person is likely to have a severe form of the virus or not. 

## Submit :trophy:

To submit your work, think about pushing your changes. It is important to push so that we are able to assess participation.
If you have any concerns, talk to a supervisor.
