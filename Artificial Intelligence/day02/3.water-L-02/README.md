# Module 7 : Analyse Water Anomaly :pencil:

Hello, we need the skills you have acquired to respond to an emergency. The scientific team has just discovered an anomaly in the water of the rivers located near our center. There would be an abnormal decrease of the oxygen level in the water which would cause the death of the river species.

We have detected that this anomaly comes from the radiations present in the ambient air. This rate changes every 15 hours, and we would like to be able to predict the rate of oxygen in the water according to the rate of radiation in the ambient air. We have provided you with all the data we have. 

We count on you!

## Consigne : 

Refer to the file `water-L-O2.py`.

> You have in the folder `data/` all the necessary data.  

+ Create a `getData()` function to retrieve and clean this data.

> Use pandas to study and understand the data.

+ Create a function (an iterator) to separate the data into batches.

+ Implement a Python `main` using your `Neurone` class creating an AI capable of predicting the level of oxygen in water based on the level of radiation in the air.  

## Submit :trophy:

To submit your work, think about pushing your changes. It is important to push so that we are able to assess participation.
If you have any concerns, talk to a supervisor.
