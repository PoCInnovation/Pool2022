# PoC Software Pool 2022 - Day 03 - REST API

**Day purposes**

:heavy_check_mark: Discover HTTP server with Gin.

:heavy_check_mark: Learn basics and good practises of web development.

:heavy_check_mark: Secure your endpoints with validators.

:heavy_check_mark: Explore request's resources, their location and usage.

## Introduction

In our modern world, **everything** is a story of [server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_web_server).

If you want to share a resource on the internet you will need a server. You
want to save your picture into a cloud? Same. You want to access PoC's amazing
subject? Everything is on GitHub and by extension, on their servers.

They have many usages and everyone uses it daily. One of the most common is
the resource sharing. With server and a protocol, you can share resource between application or clients.

Those kinds of application are called [API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-are-application-programming-interfaces),
it's an interface exposed to let your application share resources with other application
or consumers. For example, you can ask for the weather through a [weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com).

To communicate, APIs follow the [HTTP protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)
and standard. The most popular is [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer).

Below a simple schema of an API and a client.

This subject will give you all knowledge required to create a secure REST API.

## Step 0 - Setup

In your pool repository, create a new directory for the `day03`

```shell
mkdir -p day03
```

- Initialize a Go module `SoftwareGoDay3`.

> See [day01](../../day01/Golang) if you do not remember how initialize a Go module.

# Step 1 - Hello Web

Let's begin with a simple `hello world`. Indeed, it will be more complex
than a simple hello world function called from a main, but it's not that hard.

First, we must create a server using [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
package. It's the most popular framework to create server with Golang.
> ***Please take a moment to read the documentation.***\
> Here is the [quickstart](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#quick-start)

When your `server` is correctly initialize, launch it to listen on port `8080`.

> We encourage you to display a message that display your server root
> endpoint to easily reach it.\
> For example: `server listening on http://localhost:8080/`

You must also define an endpoint `hello` reachable through the 
[method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) `GET`.<br>
When hitting the endpoint, it must respond `world` and status `200`.

To do so :
- Create a package `routes` with your Router and Controllers.
- Create a package `server` with:
  - A structure `Server` (storing your Gin Engine).
  - A fonction `NewServer()` that will instanciate a new Server.
- Create a main to launch your Server.

Here is an example to manage your routes.
```go
package router

import (
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func world(c *gin.Context) {
}

func ApplyRoutes(r *gin.Engine) {
  //r.HttpMethod(route, controller)
}
```

## Step 2 - Where are data?

### Theory

In [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol),
data are stored in different part of the request depending on the data type :

- [`body`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_message_body): message in the
request. Generally used to store structured data in a given format (`JSON`, `XML`, ...)
- [`query`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string): a string that
extends the url to fill parameter of type `key/value`. Generally used to
give additional information about the request.<br>
For example: order of data return, max number of entities etc... It also
used for [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization).
- [`url param`](https://doriantaylor.com/policy/http-url-path-parameter-syntax): a dynamic
string in the path. Generally used to select a resource directly from
the url. For example: `http://localhost:3000/cat/1` select the resource `cat` with
the id `1`.
- [`cookie`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies): used to
store session (keep user logged in) or track user activity.
- [`header`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers): a `key/value` stored
used for contextual information. You can specify type of your request, proxy
information, give API KEY, how server should manage cache etc...

### Here we are

It's time to create your different endpoints.

#### Query

Create the endpoint `/repeat-my-query`, it must define the following handler
for the method `GET`:

If there is a message in the [query](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#querystring-parameters),
return it with status `200`.<br>
If there is no message: return `400`.

#### Param

Create the endpoint `/repeat-my-param/:message`, it must define the following handler
for the method `GET`:

Take as [url parameter](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#parameters-in-path)
a `message` and return it with status `200`.

#### Body

Create the endpoint `/repeat-my-body`, it must define the following handler
for the method `POST`:

If there is a `message` in the [`body`](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#try-to-bind-body-into-different-structs)
of your request, return it with status `200`.<br>
If there is no message: return `400`.

#### Header

Create the endpoint `/repeat-my-header`, it must define the following handler
for the method `GET`:

If there is a [header](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#serving-data-from-reader)
`X-Message`, return it with status `200`.<br>
If there is no message: return `400`.

#### Cookie

Create the endpoint `/repeat-my-cookie`, it must define the following handler
for the method `GET`:

If there is a [cookie](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#set-and-get-a-cookie)
`message`, return it with status `200`.<br>
If there is no message: return `400`.

> You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) to test your HTTP endpoints.

> You should check [AbortWithStatus](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gin-gonic/gin#Context.AbortWithStatus).

## Step 3 - A scaling issue

### Theory

It's common to configure your web server when you are about to launch it.<br>
In those case, you can't just hardcode value in your code, you need another
way.

[Environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) 
are the best way to configure a software behavior.
You can check them by tipping `env` in your terminal.

Those variables are used when you deploy an application in production to
specify some parameters that will affect the global behavior of your app.
It can also be used to pass sensitive information, API Key, secrets etc...

It's essential to know how use it! In this step, we will try to dynamically
configure your `host` and `port` when running the server, and create a 
dynamic greeting message.

As well, it's important to think about your configuration from the beginning
of your application by putting any variable that should be configurable into
your environment.

### Installation

Let's install the package [dotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv) in order to load automatically environment variables from a file.

```shell
go get github.com/joho/godotenv
```

### Practice

Now you can create a file `.env` that will `export` the following
environment variable :
- `SERVER_PORT`: `8080`
- `SERVER_HOST`: `localhost`
- `HELLO_MESSAGE`: `world`

Let's create a file `serverConfig.go` in the directory `server`.

> In order to keep a clean architecture, it's common to dedicate a file 
> to your API configuration.

In it, use the [envconfig](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/envconfig) package to create a structure storing your server's environment variables.

Update the needed files to use your environment variables.

If your `.env` contains sensitive information, **do not push it**! A good
practice is to create a file `.env.example` that will define the
same environment variables but without value.

## Step 4 - HTTP status

REST API return data according to customer's desire, but in case he tries to
access to data that he doesn't own, or who do not exist, the REST API will
not be able to do what he asked for.

When this happens, the REST API must explicitly send an error. To do so,
we can use [HTTP code](https://medium.com/@sahelasumi/http-status-codes-31644d99fb1)
help use understand what happened. Those codes are essentials and must be
correctly set from your REST API.

For example, a response with status `404` means that the resource has not been
found in the server, `201` stands for resource creation and `200` is used
when everything went well.

Let's create an endpoint `/health` that will always return the status `200`.<br>
If that endpoint fails when you test it, you are sure that your server is not
working. That's call a health-check!

Even if status code make sense of their own, you do not know the meaning of [every status
code](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status).
<br> <!-- COMMENT: it breaks the paragraph if I don't put br in the next line -->
When the client receive response status, it's his own responsibility to properly
handle it. But it's important to explicit those statuses code in your codebase.

To do so, we will use aliases instead of the raw number. This way it will be really easy to
understand what we return in our response.

Now, replace all raw http status by those one [exported](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#pkg-constants)
by the [package http](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http).

## Step 5 - Testing time

Since [day01](../../day01/Golang), we asked you to create tests to verify
the behavior of your functions. API are not exception and there are also
tools to manage tests.

To do so, you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com), it's a powerful 
GUI to make requests, tests suites and many other useful stuff like API 
mockup, documentation etc...

Install Postman and create a [Postman collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/intro-to-collections/)
to tests every endpoint previously coded.<br>
After you create your request, you should be able to run a whole [test-suite](https://www.postman.com/use-cases/api-testing-automation/)
on your server.

You can also create an [environment](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/)
to manage your configuration.

## Step 6 - Who use hard coded text?

It's important to transform data sent to the client to make the API easier to use.<br>
With time, data took standard forms like `JSON` or `XML`. Here we will use
the most popular: [`JSON`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

Create an endpoint `/repeat-all-my-queries` with a handler on method `GET`.

This handler must retrieves all [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string)
znd return an array of object containing the `key` and the `value` of each
query parameter.

Here's the shape of the data return

```json
[
    {
        "key": "<key of the query>",
        "value": "<value of the query>"
    }
]
```

As it returns an Object array, you have to create a `structure`.

## Step 7 - Some logic 🤯

In the previous step, you learnt how format data. We will increase a bit
the difficulty by working with it.

Create an endpoint `/are-these-palindromes` with a handler on method `POST`.

This endpoint must take a JSON body containing an array of string like the
one below

```json
[
    "meow",
    "lol"
]
```

And it must return an array of object containing the string and a boolean
set to `true` if the string is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome).

Here's an example :

```json
[
    {
        "input": "meow",
        "result": false
    },
    {
        "input": "lol",
        "result": true
    }
]
```

You will need to call [string's method](https://pkg.go.dev/strings)
to correctly complete this exercice.

## Step 8 - Server's bodyguard

> This exercice is not useful, please go the further step

It's important to know what kind of data are sent to your API. This will
help you to keep an API resilient and secured.

For example, if you send an empty body to the endpoint from step 7, you should
get an error. That kind of issue is not suitable in a production API.

To ensure API security, a system has been created: [`Middleware`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware).

> Middleware can also be used for other purposes: logger, permissions management etc...

Here's a code snippet of a [middleware for an gin API](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#custom-middleware) :

```go
func Logger() gin.HandlerFunc {
    return func(c *gin.Context) {
        // before request
        t := time.Now()

		// Set example variable
		c.Set("example", "12345")


		c.Next() // Next function to be executed

		// after request
		latency := time.Since(t)
		log.Print(latency)

		// access the status we are sending
		status := c.Writer.Status()
		log.Println(status)
	}
}
```

- Create a `middlewares` package, containing the `CheckPalindrome` function.
> Here's [how to validate body with gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#model-binding-and-validation).\
> If the body is invalid, return the right error code with an explicit error message.

- Apply this middleware to the `/are-these-palindromes` endpoint.
> Here's [how to use middlewares with gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin#using-middleware).

## Step 9 - Time to clean up

At this point, you should have many endpoints in one file in your package `routes` :
- Some simply retrieves content in the request and return it.
- One analyses palindromes.
- One says a message.
- One checks health.

It's time to organize our endpoints into different files.

Create the file `routes/index.go` with the following content :
```go
package routes

import (
	"github.com/gin-gonic/gin"
)

func ApplyRoutes(r *gin.Engine) error {
	applyHealth(r)
	applyHello(r)
	applyRepeat(r)
	applyPalindrome(r)
	return nil
}
```

Then create these files: `routes/health.go`, `hello.go`, `palindrome.go`, `repeat.go`.

Now move your endpoints into corresponding files and create the required functions.
> `ApplyRoutes` should be the only exported function.\

You should have the following architecture :

```
...
routes/
  health.go
  hello.go
  index.go
  palindrome.go
  repeat.go
...
```

## Bonus

If you are still looking for exercices, here are two intermediate exercises.

### Testing time, round 2

Postman is a powerful tool, but it's an external tool... you need a team
who knows the tool and everything relate to it. As well, it's hard to
create complexe pipeline with Postman, scripts work good, but it does not
feel natural compared to code.

Here is [how to write a tests suite](https://kpat.io/2019/06/testing-with-gin/) for each endpoint to verify that it correctly handles errors and works well.

### Expose Data
