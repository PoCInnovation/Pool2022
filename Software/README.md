# :wave: Welcome to the PoC Software Pool 2022!

During one week, you will be able to discover the different facets of software development: from database management to devops, through a tour of existing technologies.

At the end of this pool, you will have the keys to start any software project.

The pool is divided in 2 parts: a training and an application of knowledge.
