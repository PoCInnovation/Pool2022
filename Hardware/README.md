# :wave: Welcome to hardware Pool 2022 of PoC !

During one week, you will be able to discover several facets of the hardware: from the communication between modules/sensors, more advanced concepts like iot, communication protocols. :rocket:

You will have, at the end of this pool, all the keys in hand to start any low level project.

The pool is divided in 2 parts: a training and an application of knowledge.

The training takes place in 5 days, each day will focus on a hardware theme and will be supervised by students with great knowledge in these fields. Daily talks are also scheduled to clarify the most complex notions and to bring very important additional knowledge.

External speakers will also come to bring their experience in the field and explain the main axes of development in a company.

> :warning: You will find all the [setup of the days here](SETUP.md)
